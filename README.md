The following project describes a way to complete a very simple operation by using a combination of Google Cloud and third party products. There could many other ways to do the same thing in a more secure and compact manner. We have fondly and half-jokingly named this little project the Google Cloud Rube Goldberg Machine, due to its over-rotated and unnecessarily complex architecture, which at the end of the day only achieves a very trivial task. 

For more information about Rube Goldberg, a super cool American cartoonist, and how fun and awesome his work was, please visit: https://www.rubegoldberg.org/
